**3. Summary:**  
My goal right now is to learn design and create products that people could use at ease. I became interested in Front-End when I had UI course last semester, where we learned about good practises (what colors are the best, contrasts, how eyes perceive websites and their layouts, etc.) and HTML/CSS/JS basics. As a constant internet user myself, I often notice what things could be done better, whether it is a website or a program (like a computer game). That motivates me to learn not only how to spot, but also fix those mistakes. I am quite independent and can self-teach the materials given (or I can find it myself if there is a clear task). I still believe that mentor should show directions and maybe help with complicated problems, but an eager student can do everything himself.

**4. Skills:**  
Languages - C++ (Procedure and OOP), SQL, HTML/CSS/JS basics, Python basics;  
Tools - MySQL, VS Code, Visual Studio, PyCharm, Git and GitHub;  
Methodologies - Kanban, also have general knowledge about Agile;  

**5. Code examples:**  

Latest codes that I have are a [few optimization algorithms](https://github.com/GudUgne/Opti_1/blob/main/Source.cpp) and [Blockchain basics university task](https://github.com/GudUgne/Block_2/blob/main/Block_2/Block_2.cpp) where i learned about things such as Merkle tree, hashing and transactions. Both projects were written in C++;

**6. Experience:** 
As I started learning about Front-End just recently, the only projects that I have are from university UI course:  

In this course not only I had to create a [mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/Ti46rTTimhQqbP0cpHSL0X/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1), but also write specifications and task analysis for a website idea that I had (which was Zero Waste store).

Another simple project for the same class was [calculator](https://github.com/GudUgne/Old_Calc). It is not perfect, but as my first project, I learned a lot about coding do's and dont's.

**7. Education:** currently a 2nd year student in Vilnius University (Information Systems Engineering, B.S. in Informatics) 
The most crucial university courses that I already had are the basics of UI, Database basics, Procedure/OOP programming, Bussiness Process Management and Requirements Engineering;
Right now I am studying Project Management, Optimization and OS;

For 3 months have also attended Women Go Tech webinars "Atrask Technologijas", 
where I have been introduced to IT industry in more detail and learned about various positions, such as UI/UX design, Cyber Security and Testing.

**8. English:**
For about 6 years, few times a week I voice chat with long distance friends from North America. 
They work in IT industry too, so we often discuss their experiences and problems that they have encountered, as well as share materials, such as books or videos (everything is in English).  
I also had a mandatory C1 level English university course for one semester.
